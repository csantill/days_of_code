## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}


setwd("F:/Development/days_of_code/CDC/RProject/CDCData")
stategeoms <- geojsonio::geojson_read("Data/us-states.geojson", what = "sp")
cdcAnnualData <- readRDS("Data/cdcAnnualData.rds")
cdcAnnualData %<>% filter(Year="2016") 

map <- leaflet(stategeoms)%>% addTiles() %>% addTiles() %>%
      setView(lng = -93.85,
              lat = 37.45,
              zoom = 4)


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
